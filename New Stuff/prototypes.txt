Its important to have prototypes defined before the actual implementation
as: 
    better organisation
    allows function calls before function even defined
    allows us to even do type checking...acting as a safeguard
    
ex. 
 int add(int, int);
 int main() {....}
 int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
    }
