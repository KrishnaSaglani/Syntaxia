1. We are mostly passing structure by pointer as:
Pass by value:
    -simple, but can't modify function using this. Only a COPY of it is passed.
    ALso, if struct is big... its becomes time consuming to pass a copy every time

Pass by Reference:
    void displayStudent(const Student &s) {  // Pass by reference (no copy)
        cout << "Name: " << s.name << ", Age: " << s.age << endl;
    }

    -no need to pass copy...can modify data


Pass by pointer:
        void updateStudent(Student *s) {  // Pass pointer to structure
        if (s) {  // Check for nullptr
            s->age += 1;  // Modifies actual structure
        }
    }

    -can modify data...better for dynamic memory management purposes
